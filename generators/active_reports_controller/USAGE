Description:
    Creates the file containing the base class that
    all reports extend.

Example:
    `./script/generate active_reports_controller`

    This will create:
        app/controllers/active_reports_controller.rb
        
    If app/controllers/active_reports_controller.rb
    exists, it will ask you whether or not you wish
    to overwrite the file. Generally it is safest to
    say no in case you have made any changes (such
    as adding a `before_filter :require_admin` or
    similar).
