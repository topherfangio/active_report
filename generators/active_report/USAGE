Description:
    Creates all of the files neccessary to generate
    a basic report and adds the appropriate route to
    `routes.rb`. It does not create the base class
    for the controllers, to do so, run the
    active_reports_controller generator.

Example:
    `./script/generate active_report UserReport`

    This will create:
        app/controllers/user_reports_controller.rb
        app/models/user_report.rb
        app/view/user_reports
        app/view/user_reports/create.html.erb
        app/view/user_reports/new.html.erb
